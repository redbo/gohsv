gohsv [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/redbo/gohsv?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/redbo/gohsv)
=============

This is a implementation of an in-memory HSV colorspace image for go.  It
is similar to image.RGBA, image.CMYK, etc.  I'll make it satisfy the
drawer.Image interface as well when I get to it.

It also contains utility functions RGBtoHSV and HSVtoRGB.
